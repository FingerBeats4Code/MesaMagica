1. Session Timeout Policy
2. Active Order Check

If there’s an active unpaid order, don’t close immediately.

Instead, mark it as pending verification and notify staff to confirm:

Either “Customer left without paying”

Or “Still active order”


3. Automatic Cleanup Job (Scheduler)

Run a background service every few minutes (e.g., HostedService in .NET) that:

Checks stale sessions (inactive > threshold)

Frees the table and closes order/session

Optionally logs this in “SessionAudit”

4. Heartbeat / Keep-Alive

When the customer app or browser is open, send periodic “keep-alive” pings.

If pings stop (browser closed, no action in 30 mins), auto-close the session.

6. Notifications

Notify:

Customer: “Your session will expire in 10 mins.”

Staff: “Table #4 occupied for more than 2 hours without activity.”


7. Edge Case Handling

Customer scans but doesn’t order → Auto-close after 15–20 mins.

Order placed but not paid → Keep until payment timeout or manual action.

Action	System Behavior
Customer scans QR	Create session with timestamp
Customer leaves without ordering	Session expires after X mins, table auto-freed
Customer orders but doesn’t pay	Mark as pending; alert staff after threshold
Staff forgets to close table	Cleanup job closes automatically after Y hours


⚙️ SignalR in Multitenant Systems
✅ Works Well When

Each tenant (restaurant) has isolated hubs or groups.

You use scaling backplane (e.g., Redis or Azure SignalR Service).

You manage connections per tenant, not globally.
